This project implements Linear Regression from scratch using both the Normal Equation and Gradient Descent. The goal is to compare both methods on synthetic data generated from the equation 𝑦 = 3 + 4 𝑥 + 𝜖 y=3+4x+ϵ.  
Both methods converged to nearly identical parameters, demonstrating that gradient descent—when properly tuned—can match the precision of the closed-form solution even on noisy data. This validates the effectiveness of iterative optimization for linear regression.
